# Simple-Chatbot-Kotlin
A simple chat bot with a few functions that demonstrate the basic concepts of Kotlin.
It starts out giving it's own information, and then asks the user for it's name. It has the ability of finding the user's age by giving it the remainders of 3, 5 and 7.
The bot can count up to any given number the user inputs, and also does a little quiz, which the user can answer. 
The program finishes upon the user selecting the right answer.
